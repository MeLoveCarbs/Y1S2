In Rn:

If two vectors are linearly dependent their span is the line determined by the vectors (the line made by a vector starting at the origin).

If two vectors are linearly independent their span is the plane.

For three linearly independent vectors the span is the entire three dimensional space.

If the three vectors are linearly dependent then it is either a plane or a line depending on "how linearly dependent" the vectors are.



WHY zero vector must exist in a linear span: 
Starting with a set of vectors {vi}, the span of that set is defined to be every vector which can be expressed as a linear combination of elements of the set.  The 'zero' in any particular context is always a linear combination of any set of elements, and in this context, the zero vector is a linear combination of any set of vectors. 0*(x,y,z) + 0*(a,b,c) for span{(x,y,z)+(a,b,c)}
